## How would you pass parameters that a function needs to change
(mutable parameters)
### A: pass a mutable data type (list, dict, object of a class)

## Can you sort a dictionary? 
### A: Yes you can, usually if you want a sorted dictionary, you could create an OrderedDict from the start. But typically dictionaries are not the usual data type to use if you want the items to be sorted. They're best for accessing items quickly using the key. Its one of the fastest operations in Python for eg. dict["key"]

## Are there any restrictions for the data type a key in a dictionary should be?
### A: Keys must be hashable. So they can be string, int, float, tuple, bool. (All mutuble types work) -> therefor NO dicts or lists

Can you concatenate two dictionaries?
A: Yes, sort of, you can use the update method or a shortcut would be concat_dict = dict1 | dict2. However if you try add a new dictionary to the current one, and they have two of the same key values, the old/original key value will be "updated" by the new one you're adding/concatenating

How to measure the length of execution of a block of code?

How to copy the instance of a class?

What is the lifetime of a class?



What if i'm not sure if it's required to use deep copy? is there a significant performance trade off that would prevent us from using deep copy as the default solution for all copying situations


How does Python manage large variables? (In C++ we would manage memory manually)



Can you force Python code to be compiled? (evaluate the syntax everywhere in the code)

What does the dir() command show, other than variable names?
A: You can use dir(__builtins__) to show all the built in functions Python has
