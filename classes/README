What is a class?
- a collection of data structures and functions

What a class is good for?
 - to group similar data
 - to structure data
 
2 thingd about classes:
 - data (atrributes)
 - methods (special function inside a class)

classes vs instances
- you can make instances of a class (concrete objects of a class)

Strict encapsulation doesn't exist in python

special comment:

special function (__..__) - constructor

in python you don't need to write *getter* and *setter* functions

what is a lifetime of a class?
- in python we have reference counting, and if that number = 0, that's mean that there is no instance of a class
